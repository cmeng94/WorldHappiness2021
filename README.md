# World Happiness Report 2021

## Installation

The code makes use of the Python packages "pandas", "numpy", "seaborn", and "matplotlib.pyplot". The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivations

For this project, I am interested in using the world happiness report to learn:

1. Which countries are regions are the happiest in 2021?
2. What factors contribute to the happiness score?
3. Are there any changes over time?

## File Descriptions

The notebook used for the analysis is "happiness2021.ipynb".

## Results
